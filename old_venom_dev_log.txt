. names of test cases (ota type) - default name is generic ota test -DONE

. create seperate form for autogen - DONE

. ability for multiple nodes (seperate) - DONE

. change radio buttons to drop list - DONE
	add Other selection that shows text box to dump a mqtt bake 350 in  - DONE
	add check to make sure filled out correclty (all fields not empty)  - DONE

4. add email features (results and csv's)

5. switch to mac address being unique - verify what situation robin saw about changing ips (could be very small changes additional lookup etc.) - IN PROGRESS

6. remote enable ?? - will need to figure this out
   send email that remote enable is disabled and ota testing cannot continue
   revisit auto subscription issue for indigo - DONE


7. add button to paylist to insert a bake 350 - OUT OF SCOPE

8. revist venom parent form clicking 'stop running' button click logic, must close all threads - DONE
   lock all buttons and fields while running - DONE

9. set ideal sizes for window form and datagrid columns - resize forms on load to ideal? - DONE

10. check mqtt ota payload to make sure right format (update:update:) - BAD IDEA - DONE

11. figure out why log is multi writing (using foreach so thread writes multiple times, set to only find one ip and write result) - DONE
    may want to make output 'server' like in parallel prog (example on school github)

12. figure out why status 0 return (immediate) did not get caught and then saw massive lag - DONE

13. Update 2 hour timeout clock saw multiple calls of the method - DONE
    add ability to log timeout failure if thread dies and move onto next
    don't end thread (will be needed for dload/iap while loops in RunTask)
    can call sig.Wait(X) with X timeout, can query timeout also??
    after timeout is reached, check result in dgv (bad sync from wait-->set but result was good)

14. fix 'loop'

15. figure out a way to test for white screen and do node query
    node query on new api (tbd but on bruno m2m github) 
    model/serial number do NOT populate when white screen locked
 
16. need extra detection of ota success from trace in case mqtt is down and status doesn't post otherwise, thread stuck
    just need to add an extra OR for trace (what is unique to trace when final status is sent on mqtt out)when status is 
    checked within process payload perhaps :1545 

17. try_catch everything any thread could touch - DONE

18. Add pop up window containing complete execution information - DONE
    add average time of ota to log (track beginning - end) maybe do average time of each run

19. fix endthread() or ideally, improve logic to never call it (tied to 13.) - DONE
    could use sig.Wait(timeout) this will not kill thread and will release lock after timeout

20. See why previous result is getting overwritten - DONE

21. Add button to move test case in list up/down

22. for traceconnect, move cai/cio outside of func call, then see if !cai.IsTrace and add cai as traceconn param (purge old responses req params) - DONE

23. prevent non-csv files from being imported and check if first field is a valid ip address (index 0)
    if not, don't import

24. for long wait calls (1 min and over - see CONSTANTS) don't call wait cause it can't be interrupted 
    (use a manualresetevent that EACH thread makes) - otherwise, all threads will wait on one lock at a time, turns into linear execution
    can we make such logic for the th.Start in wait itself? - DONE

25. all autogen test cases will need a way to check for pass fail
    download ota, can get app input?
    model/sn check
    extra thread to check these values and update DGV? - turn into slave master?

26. DGV use autosizecolumn after import or add on paylist window - DONE
